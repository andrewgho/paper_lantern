paper_lantern - paper lantern flashlight diffuser
=================================================

This is a set of 3D printable objects which turn a flashlight and a cheap
paper lantern into a beautiful room light that is easy to travel with.

Description
-----------

Light quality (a relaxing color temperature and high color rendering) is very
important for my mood and well-being. At home, I have many small lamps with
very warm LED bulbs or with low-wattage incandescent or halogen bulbs. But,
when traveling, even the most luxurious hotel or AirBnB may have lighting
which is cold, harsh, or too bright. When it is evening, I want my residence
to be cozy and welcoming.

As a flashlight geek (this is you if you browse
[/r/flashlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight) or
[BLF](https://budgetlightforum.com/)), I usually travel with a
[Lumintop FW3A](https://lumintop.com/product/fw3a/) with LED emitters that are
very warm (2700K) and have a high color rendering index (95 CRI).

This set of 3D printable objects is a flashlight diffuser that snaps on to a
flashlight and mates it with a
[cheap (USD $1) paper lantern](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CWXCNL94)
which can collapse flat for packing, creating a portable room lighting
solution that is as high quality as whatever flashlight you already own.

The diffuser friction-fits on the flashlight, has a hat on top to prop the top
of the lantern open, and has a spacer collar on the bottom which hooks onto
the wire hoops that most paper lanterns have.

All the parts other than the diffuser tube are flat for easy packing. I put
them all into a one-quart zipper bag:

With this setup, I can turn off any harsh room lighting in the hotel or AirBnB
and enjoy beautiful warm light that I brought with me.

There are some very nice commercially available rechargeable lanterns, even
ones with paper shades, such as these
[TOCHIN](https://www.instagram.com/torchin__/) (sometimes spelled "TORCHIN")
lanterns sold in Japan:

This is a great product, with a beautiful wooden base, but it doesn't collapse
for packing, and is quite fragile—the paper diffuser is fixed in place.

There is an awesome open-source 3D printable
[Diffuser Lamp and Base for Emisar Lights](https://www.printables.com/model/836266-diffuser-lamp-and-base-for-emisar-lights)
made by [@Spicy3d](https://spicy3dprints.com/) which I have traveled with
before):

I love this lampshade (it's so cute!), but it is tricky to pack (takes up a
lot of room, and can be a bit fragile unless you can print it in ABS).
