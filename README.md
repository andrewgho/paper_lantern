paper_lantern - paper lantern flashlight diffuser
=================================================

This is a 3D printable object which turns a flashlight and a cheap collapsible
paper lantern into a beautiful room light.

Description
-----------

Light quality (a relaxing color temperature and high color rendering) is very
important for my mood and well-being. At home, I have many small lamps with
either very warm LED bulbs, or in some cases low-wattage incandescent or
halogen bulbs. But when traveling, even the most luxurious hotel or AirBnB
may have lighting which is cold, harsh, or too bright. When it is evening,
I want my residence to be cozy and welcoming.

I am a flashlight geek (you know this is you if you browse
[/r/flashlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight) or
[BLF](https://budgetlightforum.com/)), I travel with a
[Lumintop FW3A](https://lumintop.com/product/fw3a/) with LED emitters that are
very warm (2700K) and have a high color rendering index (95 CRI).

This set of 3D printable objects is a flashlight diffuser that snaps on to a
flashlight and mates it with a cheap (USD $1.50) paper lantern which can
collapse flat for packing, creating a portable room lighting solution that
is as high quality as whatever flashlight you already own.

The diffuser friction fits on the flashlight, has a hat on top to prop the top
of the lantern open, and has a spacer collar on the bottom which hooks onto
the wire hoops that most paper lanterns have.

There are some very nice commercially available rechargeable lanterns, even
ones with paper shades, such as these

lanterns sold in Japan:

There is also an awesome open-source 3D printable

made by [@Spicy3d](https://spicy3dprints.com/) which I have traveled with
before I designed this lantern:

It's great, but is a little tricky to pack (takes up a lot of room and can be
a bit fragile unless you can print it in ABS).
